# Lucidchart
This is going to be a really short summary because the website was super easy to use and it literally took maybe three minutes to make the entire thing. Overall I would not be able to fathom how anyone would have trouble using Lucidchart.

# Introduction to Networking

### Data Transmission
The term "Packet" goes with the definition "Unit of data". The term " Packet-Switching" goes with the definition "Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address". The "term IP Adress" goes with the definition "Unique identifying number". The term "DNS" goes with the definition "Set of rules to allow devices to communicate". The term Protocol goes with the definition "Directory of IP address common names". Each one of the terms goes with the definition due to the nature of what they are and nothing else. Sorry but not sure how you want me to tell you they go with eachother without just giving you the definition again? 

### Netwroking Hardware
The benefit of a switch over a hub is very simple. A networked device can be identified using a MAC address which allows the switch to keep the traffic constant, It has an increased capacity over a hub, comes with less burden, more secure than a hub, a much higher bandwith, and etc. There are a lot more than this but I think this justifies the point. The benefit of the router is that its basically the third version of the previous two but it can do everything better and over the oonline network instead of just locally like the others. Single point of failure is when the central hub or switch fails then all the computers on it will also fail, and the topologies that experience that are Bus, Ring, and Star. I think that wireless mesh is the best one because there are less wires to rely on and worry about where as using a topology may be considered outdated and risky.

### Network design 
My design is nothing special, just did as the instructions stated and hopefully its right.
